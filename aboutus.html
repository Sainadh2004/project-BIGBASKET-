BigBasket began as a tech startup company, founded in December 2011 by five entrepreneurs who had survived the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. The startup was initially funded by private equity investor Ascent Capital (Bangalore) with a capital injection of $10 million.[10]

In 2015, Bigbasket acquired the hyperlocal delivery company Delyver to build its last-mile delivery network.[12]

By mid-2016, Bigbasket was operating in eight large Indian cities and had grown to become India's biggest e-grocer.[10] The company's unique selling point was delivery of fresh produce, based on the purchase of fruit and vegetables from local marketplaces each morning, storage in refrigerated warehouses and a fleet of temperature-controlled trucks to deliver fresh to the door.[10][13]

China's Alibaba Group led a $300 million funding round in early 2018 to become the main shareholder in the company,[2] taking the online grocer's valuation up to $950 million.[10] By May 2019, BigBasket was operating across 25 Indian cities,[2] and became India's newest 'unicorn' (a startup valued at more than $1 billion) by raising $150 million in a new funding round led by Mirae Asset-Naver Asia Growth Fund, the CDC Group and Alibaba.[14]

In October 2020, BigBasket suffered a data breach exposing the data of more than 20 million users, which included email, IP and physical addresses, names, phones numbers, dates of birth and passwords.[15]

The company was valued at around $1.85 billion in May 2021. Demand for online grocery shopping increased considerably in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and by the start of 2022, BigBasket was processing over 7 million orders per month.[16]

Tata Group became the owner of BigBasket in May 2021, when its Tata Digital subsidiary acquired a 64% majority stake in the company.[17] In January 2023, BigBasket received a $200 million injection from investors, including majority shareholder Tata Digital, taking the company valuation up to $3.2 billion.[1][3]
